# Abduction

This game, which will basically be a Puzzle, aims to show all the cultures in the world where the character who is an ET is looking to abduct an animal from each place in the world, but whenever he tries to do so, the curious can take photos and that should not happen, as the character must follow a logical sequence where each jump changes the attention of the curisos and it is necessary to use your head to abduct the animal and not be seen. For now I'm implementing basic mechanics to be tested by my friends and co-workers.
